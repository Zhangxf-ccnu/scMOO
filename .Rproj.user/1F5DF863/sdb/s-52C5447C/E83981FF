The combination weights and latent structures are learned using multi-objective optimization, and the weighted average of the observed data and the imputation results learned from the three types of structures is considered as the final result.\nLicense: GPL-2\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.1.1\nDepends: R (>= 3.5.0)\nImports: keras, tensorflow, rsvd\nSuggests: knitr, rmarkdown\nVignetteBuilder: knitr\n\n\n",
