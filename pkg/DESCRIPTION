Title: Accurate gene expression recovery for single-cell RNA sequencing via multi-objective optimization
Version: 1.1
Author: Ke Jin, Xiao-Fei Zhang
Maintainer: Ke Jin <kej13@mails.ccnu.edu.cn>
Description: scMOO assumes that the data is a combination of three types of latent structures, horizontal structure (genes are similar with each other), vertical structure (cells are similar with each other), and low-rank structure. The combination weights and latent structures are learned using multi-objective optimization, and the weighted average of the observed data and the imputation results learned from the three types of structures is considered as the final result.
